# odin-recipes
My first project in TOP!

Current project is a recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. This website will be made only in HTML,because that's the only thing I know at this moment.

After I finish this website, I will know how to use HTML in a practical way. I will revise once again how to make boilerplate, how to properly type commands, insert images and links to other pages and websites.
