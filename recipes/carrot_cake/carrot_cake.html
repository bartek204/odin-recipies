    <p><h3>DESCRIPTION</h3></p>
    <p>This carrot cake is my favorite recipe, and I have tried many carrot cakes! If you don't like pecans, feel free to leave them out.</p>
    <p><h3>INGREDIENTS</h3></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups grated carrots</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h3>FROSTING</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>4 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
        </ul>
    <p><h3>STEPS</h3></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar, oil, eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Mix in flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Stir in carrots. Fold in pecans. Pour into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.</li>
            <li>To make the frosting: Beat butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir in chopped pecans. Frost the cooled cake.</li>
        </ol>
